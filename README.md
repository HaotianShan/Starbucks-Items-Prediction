# Goal
This project is about prediction, analysis, EDA of Starbucks coffee items!

# Dataset
This dataset contains the nutrition info for Starbucks menu items.

The 'Beverage_category' column classifies the type of beverage, such as coffee, tea, or smoothie. The 'Beverage' column provides the specific name of the drink, for instance, Caramel Macchiato or Green Tea Latte.

The 'Beverage_prep' column details the preparation method of the beverage, including whether it's served hot or cold, and any additional ingredients or toppings like whipped cream or syrup. The 'Calories' column lists the total caloric content of each beverage, providing insight into the energy provided by each drink.

The next three columns, 'Total Fat (g)', 'Trans Fat (g)', and 'Saturated Fat (g)', provide a breakdown of the fat content in each beverage. These columns are crucial for those monitoring their fat intake for health or dietary reasons. The 'Sodium (mg)' column indicates the amount of sodium in each beverage, which is essential information for individuals on low-sodium diets.

The 'Total Carbohydrates (g)' column provides the total carbohydrate content, including sugars, which is particularly useful for people managing diabetes or following a low-carb diet. Lastly, the 'Cholesterol (mg)' column lists the amount of cholesterol in each beverage, a critical factor for those monitoring their cholesterol levels.

This dataset serves as a comprehensive guide to the nutritional content of Starbucks beverages, making it a valuable resource for researchers, dietitians, and health-conscious consumers alike.
